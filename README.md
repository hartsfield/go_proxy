#go_proxy

This is a small program that acts as a proxy server for my websites. You can 
point multiple hostnames at one IP address, and once configured, this proxy 
will read the host name and direct the client to the appropriate port based on 
that hostname. 

It can easily be modified for your websites. See the comments in `main.go`.
